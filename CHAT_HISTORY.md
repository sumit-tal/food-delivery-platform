# Design Journey Summary

## Overview

This document tells the story of how we built the SwiftEats food‑delivery app together with the AI assistant. It shows the main choices we made, how the AI looked at different options, and points to the prompt files that have more details.

---

## 1. Project Foundations

- We started a new project using NestJS, TypeScript, and Docker. We set up core parts like authentication, database, and backup.
- The AI helped plan the structure and created the first project layout file.

**Reference**: `tasks/001-setup-project-structure.md`

---

## 2. Disaster Recovery & Backup

- We needed to decide how to protect data: quick point‑in‑time recovery or simple backups.
- The AI compared industry rules (3‑2‑1 rule, GFS) and suggested a full solution with write‑ahead logs, multiple zones, and automatic checks.
- We built backup services, disaster‑recovery services, retention policies, and added Kubernetes files.

**Reference**: `prompts/Disaster Recovery Implementation.md`

---

## 3. Security Implementation

- We chose security features like HTTPS, rate limiting, input checks, and GDPR rules.
- The AI looked at OWASP, PCI‑DSS, ISO standards and recommended a security module.
- We added HTTPS setup, a rate‑limit guard, validation middleware, audit logging, and GDPR helpers.

**Reference**: `prompts/Fixing Security Middleware Errors.md`

---

## 4. Real‑Time Notifications

- We needed to decide how to send notifications: WebSocket, Server‑Sent Events, or push only.
- The AI checked speed and scalability and chose a mix of WebSocket for live alerts plus email/SMS as backup.
- We created a notification module with entities, services, gateways, templates, and a priority queue.

**Reference**: `prompts/Implementing Real-Time Notifications System.md`

---

## 5. Circuit Breaker & Resilience

- We thought about using an existing library or writing our own circuit‑breaker.
- The AI weighed maintainability and type safety and decided to write a small, generic circuit‑breaker in `src/common/resilience`.
- We added the circuit‑breaker service, health checks, monitoring, and connected it to payment, notification, and other services.

**Reference**: `prompts/Fixing Circuit Breaker Payment Gateway Types.md`

---

## 6. Ongoing Work

- The AI kept checking the code, suggesting short functions, removing `any` types, adding tests, and writing docs.

---

## 7. Result

- All tasks from 001 to 016 are marked done.
- The app now has strong backup, security, notifications, and resilience.
- The AI acted as a design partner, helping choose options and write code.

---

## 8. Unit Test Prompt

I used the following prompt to generate unit test cases for an API:

```
I have an API that I want to test. Please generate detailed test cases.

API Details:
- Endpoint: [PUT YOUR ENDPOINT HERE]
- Method: [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]
- Headers: [List any required headers]
- Request Body (if applicable): [Provide JSON example]
- Expected Success Response: [Describe or paste example JSON]
- Error Responses: [List possible error codes and messages]

Requirements:
- Write test cases in Jest.
- Cover positive, negative, and edge cases.
- Clearly mention input, preconditions, and expected output.
- Organize them as a checklist or table.
- Use descriptive names for each test case.
```

### Example Jest Test Cases (template)

| Test Case                                 | Description                                  | Preconditions             | Input                 | Expected Output                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `shouldReturn200WhenValidRequest`         | Positive test: valid request returns success | Server running, DB seeded | `{...}`               | 200, response JSON matches schema |
| `shouldReturn400WhenMissingRequiredField` | Negative: missing field                      | Server running            | `{... missing field}` | 400, error message                |
| `shouldReturn401WhenUnauthorized`         | Negative: no auth header                     | Server running            | `{...}` with no auth  | 401, error                        |
| `shouldReturn500WhenServiceFails`         | Edge: internal error simulation              | Mock service throws       | `{...}`               | 500, error message                |
| `shouldValidateResponseSchema`            | Positive: response matches schema            | Server running            | valid request         | response matches JSON schema      |

_Replace the placeholders with the actual endpoint, method, headers, and payloads._

## 9. API Testing Fix

- While testing the API I received a 404 error. With the help of Windsurf, I provided the curl command and the response, which helped identify and fix the routing issue.

## 10. Test Points

1. It helped me set up my service quickly.
2. Guidance on which LLM model to use for each task, ensuring effective use of LLMs.
3. Assisted in writing comprehensive test cases.
