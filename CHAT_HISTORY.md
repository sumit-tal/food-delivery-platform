### User Input

@[business.prd.md] Act as a senior software architect and ask me all the technical related questions related to the attached prd.
DO NOT implement unless I explicitely ask you to.

### Planner Response

I'll review the PRD document first to understand the business requirements before asking technical architecture questions.

# Technical Architecture Questions for SwiftEats PRD

## System Architecture

1. What's your preferred approach to start with - modular monolith or microservices from day one? What's your reasoning behind this choice given the 500 orders/minute scale requirement?

2. For the planned "eventual migration to microservices" mentioned in section 4.1, what boundaries do you see as most critical to define now to enable smooth future transition?

3. How do you envision the communication patterns between your core modules (synchronous REST vs asynchronous messaging)? Which specific interfaces would benefit from each?

## Tech Stack Selection

4. Among the suggested backend frameworks (Node.js/NestJS, Django, Laravel/Symfony), which are you leaning toward and why? What's your team's experience with these technologies?

5. For the database strategy:

   - What's your planned approach for data partitioning across PostgreSQL/MongoDB?
   - Are you considering a polyglot persistence strategy or single database technology?
   - What's your sharding strategy to achieve the performance targets?

6. For the real-time location tracking system (2,000 updates/sec):
   - What's your preferred implementation for the geospatial indexing?
   - How will you handle the WebSocket connections for "near-instantaneous" updates?

## Resilience & Reliability

7. What circuit breaker implementation are you considering for third-party services?

8. How will you implement idempotency for order and payment APIs? What idempotency key strategy will you use?

9. What's your strategy for handling payment gateway failures while maintaining order atomicity?

10. How do you plan to implement the persistent storage layer to ensure orders aren't lost during upstream failures?

## Scaling Strategy

11. What's your strategy for scaling the catalog service to achieve <200ms P99 latency?

12. For Redis/Memcached caching:

    - What cache invalidation strategy will you implement to ensure data freshness?
    - How will you handle cache stampedes during high-traffic periods?

13. What's your plan for horizontal scaling of the order processing system to handle 500 orders/minute?

## Real-time Systems

14. For the real-time logistics system:

    - What's your strategy for handling 2,000 location updates/sec?
    - How will you implement the driver simulator for local testing?
    - What's your approach to geofencing and efficient proximity searches?

15. How do you plan to implement the 2-second lag requirement for driver tracking? Will you use WebSockets, server-sent events, or polling?

## DevOps & Observability

16. What's your CI/CD strategy to support "rapid changes and safe deployment"?

17. How will you implement the observability stack (ELK/Prometheus/Grafana) to monitor system performance?

18. What's your approach to distributed tracing across the different modules/services?

## Security & Performance

19. Beyond OAuth2, what specific security measures are you planning for customer data and payment information?

20. How will you balance performance optimization against development speed in the early stages?

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific area of questioning?

## Technical PRD Created

I've created the [technical.prd.md](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/technical.prd.md:0:0-0:0) file based on your architecture decisions. The document expands on your core choices with implementation details structured across these sections:

1. **System Architecture Overview**
2. **Technology Stack Specifications**
3. **Resilience & Reliability Implementation**
4. **Scaling Strategy**
5. **Real-Time Systems Implementation**
6. **Development & Operations**
7. **Security Implementation**
8. **Future Scalability Considerations**
9. **Implementation Priorities & Timeline**

### Technical Considerations

Some architecture decisions that might benefit from further refinement:

- **Circuit breaker implementation based on order ID** - Traditional circuit breakers are typically scoped to services rather than entity IDs. Consider a service-based circuit breaker approach.

- **Cache invalidation strategy based on order ID** - Menu data might need category or restaurant-based invalidation strategies instead.

- **Geospatial operations "based on order ID"** - Spatial operations are typically optimized around geographic coordinates rather than business entities.

- **Polling for real-time tracking** - This approach may create scalability challenges at 2,000 updates/second compared to WebSockets (which you selected for other real-time operations).

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section of the technical PRD or refine any particular architecture decision?
