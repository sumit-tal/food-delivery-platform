# Task 003: Restaurant & Menu Catalog

## Description

Implement the restaurant and menu catalog system with efficient caching to achieve the target latency of P99 <200ms.

## Subtasks

- Design and implement restaurant entity models
- Create menu catalog data structures
- Implement restaurant onboarding APIs
- Set up menu management endpoints
- Implement Redis caching layer for menu data
- Design optimized database schema for read-heavy operations
- Add versioned cache keys for atomic updates
- Implement content delivery optimization for static menu assets

## Expected Outcome

A high-performance restaurant and menu catalog system that meets the latency requirements even under heavy load.

## Related Requirements
