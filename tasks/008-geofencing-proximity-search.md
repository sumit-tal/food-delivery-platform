# Task 008: Geofencing & Proximity Search

## Description
Implement geofencing and proximity search capabilities for efficient driver assignment and delivery zone management.

## Subtasks
- Design and implement geofencing data structures
- Set up spatial indexing for fast radius queries
- Create pre-calculated delivery zones
- Implement caching for frequently accessed geographic data
- Build proximity search APIs for restaurant discovery
- Create efficient driver assignment algorithms based on proximity
- Add polygon-based delivery area definitions
- Implement geofence event triggers for order status updates

## Expected Outcome
An efficient geofencing and proximity search system that enables optimal restaurant discovery and driver assignment.
