# Task 007: Driver Simulator

## Description
Develop a driver simulator for local testing that can simulate up to 50 drivers with realistic movement patterns.

## Subtasks
- Create configurable driver simulation engine
- Implement realistic movement patterns for virtual drivers
- Add customizable update frequency settings
- Make simulator API-compatible with production driver app
- Set up configuration for up to 50 concurrent virtual drivers
- Implement support for 10 updates/second on a development machine
- Add simulation visualization tools for debugging
- Create documentation for simulator usage

## Expected Outcome
A flexible driver simulator that allows for comprehensive testing of the real-time tracking system locally.

## Related Requirements
- **Local Demonstration**: Provide a simulator for 50 drivers/10 updates/sec to validate system function on a dev machine
- **Simulator Capabilities**: Configurable number of virtual drivers, realistic movement patterns
