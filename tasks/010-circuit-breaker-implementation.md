# Task 010: Circuit Breaker Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive circuit breaker patterns for all external service integrations to ensure system resilience.

## Subtasks
- Design circuit breaker architecture for all external services
- Implement circuit breaker based on order ID for payment gateway
- Add circuit breakers for external notification services
- Create circuit breakers for third-party integrations
- Define fallback mechanisms for each critical service
- Implement health checking and automatic recovery
- Add circuit state monitoring and alerting
- Create documentation for circuit breaker behavior

## Expected Outcome
A resilient system that can continue functioning even when external services fail, with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

## Related Requirements
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implementation based on order ID
- **Protected Services**: Payment Gateway, External Notification Services, Third-party integrations
- **Resilience**: Order processing should continue functioning even if third-party services are down
