# Task 013: Load Testing & Scaling Verification

## Description
Implement comprehensive load testing and scaling verification to ensure the system meets all performance and reliability requirements.

## Subtasks
- Design load testing scenarios for all critical system paths
- Set up automated performance testing in CI pipeline
- Implement stress tests for order processing system (500 orders/minute)
- Create load tests for real-time location updates (2,000 updates/second)
- Set up failover tests for external service outages
- Implement automated scaling verification tests
- Create performance benchmarking and regression testing
- Set up monitoring for key performance metrics during tests
- Document performance test results and scaling capabilities

## Expected Outcome
Verified system performance and scaling capabilities with comprehensive test coverage that ensures the platform meets all SLAs.

## Related Requirements
- **Load Testing**: Performance/stress CI with realistic workloads against all major APIs
- **Failover Tests**: Simulate payment, DB, or cache outages and measure user impact
- **Performance Target**: Validation of 500 orders/minute processing capability
- **Real-Time Systems**: Validation of 2,000 location updates/second throughput
