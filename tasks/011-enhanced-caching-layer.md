# Task 011: Enhanced Caching Layer

## Description
Implement an advanced caching layer with sophisticated cache invalidation strategies to optimize system performance.

## Subtasks
- Refine Redis caching implementation for menu and catalog data
- Implement time-based expiration for non-critical data
- Set up event-based invalidation for frequently changing data
- Add versioned cache keys for atomic updates
- Implement cache stampede prevention mechanisms
- Create staggered cache expiration strategy
- Set up background refresh for high-traffic cache entries
- Add lock mechanism for concurrent refresh attempts
- Implement monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios

## Expected Outcome
A high-performance caching system that significantly reduces database load and improves response times for common operations.

## Related Requirements
- **Caching Implementation**: Redis with sophisticated invalidation strategies
- **Cache Stampede Prevention**: Implemented using staggered expiration and locks
- **Performance Target**: P99 <200ms latency for menu/catalog browsing
