# Task 006: Real-Time Driver Tracking

## Description
Implement the real-time driver location tracking system that can handle 2,000 location updates per second with minimal lag.

## Subtasks
- Set up WebSockets for real-time communication
- Implement geospatial indexing using PostGIS
- Create location update processing pipeline
- Set up message queue buffering for peak handling
- Implement batched database writes for location data
- Add in-memory processing for active deliveries
- Design and implement polling mechanism with <2s lag
- Create connection management system for concurrent client connections

## Expected Outcome
A high-performance real-time driver tracking system that can handle the target throughput with less than 2-second lag to customers.

## Related Requirements
- **Scale**: Support up to 10,000 concurrent drivers (peak: 2,000 location updates/sec)
- **Real-Time Driver Tracking**: Show near-instantaneous (â‰¤2s lag) driver location to customers
- **Location Update Processing**: Throughput target of 2,000 location updates/second
