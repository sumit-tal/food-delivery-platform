# Task 012: Performance Optimization

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations across all system components to meet or exceed SLA targets.

## Subtasks
- Conduct performance profiling of critical system paths
- Optimize database query performance
- Implement database read replicas for high-volume read operations
- Enhance connection pooling configurations
- Optimize API response serialization
- Implement response compression for bandwidth efficiency
- Add database index optimization
- Fine-tune WebSocket connections for real-time services
- Optimize background job processing

## Expected Outcome
A highly optimized system that consistently meets performance SLAs under heavy load conditions.

## Related Requirements
- **Performance**: All critical endpoints must meet performance SLAs under stress
- **API Latency**: P50, P95, P99 targets
- **Database Query Performance**: Optimized for high throughput
- **Traffic Growth Projections**: Prepared for scaling to 2,500 orders/minute
