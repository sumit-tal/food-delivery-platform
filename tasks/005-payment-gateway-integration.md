# Task 005: Payment Gateway Integration

## Description
Implement a mock payment gateway integration with circuit breaker pattern for failure handling.

## Subtasks
- Design and implement payment processing interfaces
- Create mock payment gateway for testing
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for payment services
- Set up automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Create manual intervention queue for failed transactions
- Implement idempotency checks for payment transactions
- Add response caching for duplicate payment requests
- Set up persistent order state before payment initiation

## Expected Outcome
A reliable payment processing system with proper failure handling that ensures orders are never lost due to payment gateway failures.

## Related Requirements
- **Mock Payment Gateway**: Integration for end-to-end flow testing and failure handling
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implementation for payment gateway
- **Recovery Process**: Persistent order state, automatic retry mechanism
- **Resilience**: Order processing should continue functioning even if payment gateways are down
