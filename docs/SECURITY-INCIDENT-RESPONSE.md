## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis (0-30 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Incident Identification**
   - Monitor security alerts from SIEM systems
   - Review automated security audit logs
   - Investigate user reports of suspicious activity

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Classify incident severity
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Activate appropriate response team

3. **Documentation**
   - Create incident ticket with unique ID
   - Record initial findings and timeline
   - Preserve evidence and logs

#### Detection Sources
- Automated security monitoring alerts
- User reports of suspicious activity
- Third-party security notifications
- System performance anomalies
- Failed authentication patterns

### Phase 2: Containment (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Short-term Containment
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Example: Isolate compromised server
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
   sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   - Create system snapshots
   - Collect relevant logs
   - Document system state

3. **Prevent Spread**
   - Block malicious IP addresses
   - Disable compromised accounts
   - Update security rules

#### Long-term Containment
1. **System Hardening**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update access controls
   - Implement additional monitoring

2. **Backup Verification**
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Ensure clean restore points available

### Phase 3: Eradication (2-24 hours)

#### Remove Threats
1. **Malware Removal**
   - Run antivirus scans
   - Remove malicious files
   - Clean infected systems

2. **Vulnerability Patching**
   - Apply security updates
   - Fix configuration issues
   - Update security policies

3. **Account Security**
   - Reset compromised passwords
   - Revoke suspicious API keys
   - Review and update permissions

### Phase 4: Recovery (1-7 days)

#### System Restoration
1. **Gradual Restoration**
   - Restore systems from clean backups
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Conduct security testing

2. **Service Validation**
   - Verify system functionality
   - Test security controls
   - Monitor for recurring issues

3. **User Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide security guidance
   - Update security documentation

### Phase 5: Lessons Learned (1-2 weeks post-incident)

#### Post-Incident Review
1. **Incident Analysis**
   - Timeline reconstruction
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment

2. **Process Improvement**
   - Update response procedures
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities
   - Improve security controls

3. **Training Updates**
   - Conduct team debriefing
   - Update training materials
   - Schedule additional drills

## Communication Procedures

### Internal Communications

#### Immediate Notification (within 15 minutes)
- Incident Commander
- Security Team
- System Administrators
- Management (for P0/P1 incidents)

#### Regular Updates
- Hourly updates during active response
- Status updates to stakeholders
- Executive briefings for critical incidents

### External Communications

#### Customer Notification
- Required for data breaches affecting PII
- Must comply with GDPR notification requirements (72 hours)
- Coordinate with legal and PR teams

#### Regulatory Reporting
- Data protection authorities (if required)
- Industry regulators
- Law enforcement (for criminal activity)

#### Vendor Notification
- Cloud service providers
- Security service vendors
- Third-party integrators (if affected)

## Technical Response Procedures

### Log Collection
```bash
# Collect system logs
sudo journalctl --since "1 hour ago" > incident_logs.txt

# Collect application logs
docker logs swifteats-backend > app_logs.txt

# Collect network logs
sudo tcpdump -w network_capture.pcap

# Collect security audit logs
grep "SECURITY_AUDIT" /var/log/application.log > security_events.txt
```

### Network Isolation
```bash
# Block suspicious IP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <suspicious_ip> -j DROP

# Isolate compromised container
docker network disconnect bridge <container_id>

# Enable DDoS protection
# (Configure with cloud provider)
```

### Account Security
```bash
# Disable compromised user account
curl -X POST /api/v1/admin/users/{userId}/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Revoke API keys
curl -X DELETE /api/v1/admin/api-keys/{keyId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Force password reset
curl -X POST /api/v1/admin/users/{userId}/force-password-reset \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Evidence Preservation

### Digital Forensics
1. **System Snapshots**
   - Create VM snapshots before changes
   - Preserve original log files
   - Document chain of custody

2. **Log Analysis**
   - Export relevant logs to secure storage
   - Calculate file hashes for integrity
   - Maintain detailed timestamps

3. **Network Evidence**
   - Capture network traffic
   - Preserve firewall logs
   - Document network topology

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
```sql
-- Verify backup integrity
SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();

-- Restore from backup
pg_restore --clean --create --verbose backup_file.sql

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```

### Application Recovery
```bash
# Deploy clean application version
docker pull swifteats-backend:clean-version
docker stop swifteats-backend
docker run -d --name swifteats-backend swifteats-backend:clean-version

# Verify application health

tail -f /var/log/application.log | grep ERROR
```
