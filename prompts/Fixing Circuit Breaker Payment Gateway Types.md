### Planner Response

I'll help you implement the circuit breaker pattern for your food delivery platform. Let's start by creating a plan for this task.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Let's start by exploring the project structure to identify the external service integrations that need circuit breaker implementation.

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

I see that there are several services in the project that might need circuit breaker implementation. I notice there's already a [circuit-breaker.service.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/services/circuit-breaker.service.ts:0:0-0:0) in the payments module, which might be a starting point or might need to be expanded.

Let's first check if there's any existing circuit breaker implementation:

*Viewed [circuit-breaker.service.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/services/circuit-breaker.service.ts) *

### Planner Response

I see there's already a [CircuitBreakerService](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/services/circuit-breaker.service.ts:31:0-196:1) implemented for the payments module. This is a good starting point, but we need to expand it to cover all external service integrations as specified in the task.

Let's check the payment gateway implementation to see how the circuit breaker is currently being used:

### Planner Response

I've successfully implemented the circuit breaker pattern for your food delivery platform following industry standards. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. Created a common resilience module with:
   - Core circuit breaker service that manages circuit state transitions
   - Health checking service for automatic recovery of failed services
   - Monitoring service for alerting on circuit state changes

2. Implemented circuit breakers for:
   - Payment gateway services with order ID-based protection
   - Notification services (email, SMS, push) with channel-specific protection
   - Third-party integrations with appropriate fallback mechanisms

3. Added health checking and automatic recovery:
   - Scheduled health checks for open circuits
   - Automatic circuit reset when services recover

4. Created monitoring and alerting for circuit states:
   - Event-based monitoring for circuit state changes
   - Customizable alert handlers for different services

5. Created comprehensive documentation in [/docs/circuit-breaker.md](cci:7://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/docs/circuit-breaker.md:0:0-0:0) explaining:
   - Circuit breaker architecture and state transitions
   - Service-specific implementations and configurations
   - Usage examples and best practices

The implementation follows the industry-standard circuit breaker pattern with three states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN) and configurable thresholds for failures and recovery.

I've also updated the progress.md file to mark Task 010 as completed.

### User Input

@[src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts] help me fix the error of this file

### Planner Response

I'll help you fix the type errors in the circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts file. The main issue is with the fallback function type compatibility.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Looking at the circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts file, I can see there are type compatibility issues with the fallback functions. Let's analyze the errors and fix them:

*Viewed [circuit-breaker.interface.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/common/resilience/circuit-breaker.interface.ts) *

### Planner Response

Let me fix the type errors in the circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts file. The main issue is that the fallback function in the CircuitBreakerConfig interface expects a generic type parameter, but our implementation is using a specific PaymentResult type.

*Updated todo list*

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

I've fixed the type compatibility issues in the circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts file. Let me explain what I did:

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I've fixed the type compatibility issues in the circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts file. Here's what I did to resolve the errors:

1. Created separate helper methods for each operation type that return properly typed fallback functions:
   - [createAuthorizeFallback](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts:140:2-153:3)
   - [createCaptureFallback](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts:155:2-168:3)
   - [createRefundFallback](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts:170:2-183:3)
   - [createVoidFallback](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts:185:2-198:3)
   - [createStatusFallback](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts:200:2-213:3)

2. Each helper method returns a generic function that matches the expected type signature `<T>(error: Error) => T` from the CircuitBreakerConfig interface.

3. Inside each fallback function, I use the existing [createFallbackResult](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/payments/gateways/circuit-breaker-payment.gateway.ts:113:2-138:3) method but cast the result to the generic type `T` using `as unknown as T`.

This approach resolves the type compatibility issues while maintaining the same functionality. The circuit breaker will now properly handle fallbacks for each payment operation when external services are unavailable.

The code should now compile without any type errors. The implementation follows the circuit breaker pattern correctly, providing appropriate fallback behavior when the circuit is open.
