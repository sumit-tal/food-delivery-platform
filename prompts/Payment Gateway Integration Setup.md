### Planner Response

Great! We've successfully implemented the payment gateway integration for the food delivery platform. Let's summarize what we've accomplished:

## Payment Gateway Integration Summary

1. **Payment Processing Interfaces**:
   - Created comprehensive interfaces for payment gateway integration
   - Designed flexible payment details and result structures

2. **Mock Payment Gateway**:
   - Implemented a realistic mock payment gateway for testing
   - Added configurable failure simulation for resilience testing

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
   - Implemented a robust circuit breaker service to handle payment gateway failures
   - Added state transitions (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN) with configurable thresholds

4. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Created a payment retry service with exponential backoff
   - Implemented jitter to prevent thundering herd problem

5. **Failure Handling**:
   - Set up a manual intervention queue for failed transactions
   - Created persistent storage for failed payments

6. **Idempotency & Caching**:
   - Implemented idempotency checks to prevent duplicate payments
   - Added response caching for duplicate payment requests

7. **Integration with Order System**:
   - Ensured persistent order state before payment initiation
   - Connected payment processing with the existing order flow

8. **API Endpoints**:
   - Created RESTful endpoints for payment processing
   - Implemented proper authentication and authorization

9. **Unit Tests**:
   - Added comprehensive tests for payment services
   - Covered success and failure scenarios

The implementation follows industry standards for payment processing, including proper error handling, idempotency, and resilience patterns. The system is now ready to process payments reliably, even in the face of gateway failures.

Is there anything specific about the implementation you'd like me to explain in more detail?
