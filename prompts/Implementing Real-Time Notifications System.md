### Planner Response

I've successfully implemented the real-time notifications system for your food delivery platform. Let me summarize what has been accomplished:

## Implementation Summary

1. **Comprehensive Notification Module**: Created a complete notification system with support for multiple channels (in-app, email, SMS, push notifications).

2. **Notification Preferences**: Implemented user notification preferences to allow users to control which notifications they receive and through which channels.

3. **Prioritized Queue System**: Set up a notification queue with prioritization based on notification urgency, ensuring critical notifications are delivered first.

4. **Real-time Delivery**: Implemented WebSocket-based real-time notifications for immediate delivery of important updates.

5. **Notification Templates**: Created a template system for consistent notification formatting and easy content management.

6. **Read/Unread Status Tracking**: Implemented tracking of notification status (read, unread, archived).

7. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added fallback delivery methods if a primary notification channel fails.

8. **Unit Tests**: Created tests to ensure the notification system works as expected.

The implementation follows industry standards and best practices:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Using Bull/BullMQ for reliable queue management
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets via Socket.IO for instant notifications
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between notification creation, queuing, and delivery
- **Resilience**: Fallback mechanisms and retry logic for failed notifications
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new notification channels or types

All tasks have been completed and the progress.md file has been updated to reflect the completion of Task 009.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?

I'll help you fix the errors in the notification-preference.service.ts file. Let me check for any TypeScript errors related to the NotificationChannel import:

### Planner Response

Let me check the notification-preference.service.ts file for errors and fix them. The main issues appear to be related to TypeScript typing.

*Viewed [notification-preference.entity.ts](file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/notifications/entities/notification-preference.entity.ts) *

### Planner Response

Based on my analysis, there are a few issues in the notification-preference.service.ts file that need to be fixed. Let me address them:

1. The main issue is with the TypeScript typing for error handling and the `any` type usage.

Here's how I'll fix the file:

### Planner Response

Now I'll fix the remaining issue with the [setDefaultPreferences](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/notifications/services/notification-preference.service.ts:96:2-147:3) method that has too many lines. Let's refactor it to make it more concise:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

I'll fix the remaining lint warning by further refactoring the [getDefaultPreferencesConfig](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/notifications/services/notification-preference.service.ts:102:2-134:3) method to reduce its line count:

### Planner Response

Let me fix the remaining lint warnings in the notification-preference.service.ts file by refactoring the methods that exceed the 20-line limit:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

I've fixed the TypeScript errors in your notification-preference.service.ts file. Here's what I did:

1. **Added proper type annotations for error handling**:
   - Changed `catch (error)` to `catch (error: unknown)` to properly type the error variable

2. **Refactored long methods to meet the 20-line limit**:
   - Created a helper method [createOrUpdatePreference](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/notifications/services/notification-preference.service.ts:60:2-85:3) to extract common logic
   - Simplified the [updateUserPreferences](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/notifications/services/notification-preference.service.ts:87:2-110:3) method to use the helper method
   - Refactored [setDefaultPreferences](cci:1://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/notifications/services/notification-preference.service.ts:96:2-151:3) to use `Promise.all` for better concurrency

3. **Improved code organization**:
   - Simplified the default preferences configuration with reusable channel arrays
   - Used more concise syntax for object creation

These changes maintain the same functionality while making the code more maintainable and compliant with your project's linting rules. The code is now more type-safe with proper error handling and follows TypeScript best practices.

Would you like me to make any additional improvements to the notification system?
