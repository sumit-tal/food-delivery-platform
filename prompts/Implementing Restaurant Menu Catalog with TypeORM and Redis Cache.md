### Planner Response

I've successfully completed the implementation of the restaurant menu catalog system with TypeORM integration and optimized Redis caching. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. Created TypeORM entity classes:
   - [RestaurantEntity](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/entities/restaurant.entity.ts:6:0-49:1) for restaurant data
   - [MenuEntity](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/entities/menu.entity.ts:6:0-28:1) for tracking menu versions
   - [MenuCategoryEntity](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/entities/menu-category.entity.ts:7:0-34:1) for organizing menu items
   - [MenuItemEntity](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/entities/menu-item.entity.ts:7:0-51:1) for menu items

2. Implemented [PostgresRestaurantsRepository](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/repositories/postgres-restaurants.repository.ts:18:0-252:1) with TypeORM support, providing:
   - Restaurant creation and retrieval
   - Menu versioning and management
   - Optimized database queries

3. Developed [EnhancedRedisMenuCache](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/cache/enhanced-redis-menu-cache.ts:45:0-248:1) with performance optimizations:
   - Versioned cache keys for atomic updates
   - Automatic expiration for old menu versions
   - Circuit breaker pattern for Redis failures
   - Cache warming capabilities
   - Optimized for <200ms P99 latency target

4. Updated the [RestaurantsModule](cci:2://file:///Users/sumitk/Desktop/AI%20Native/food-delivery-platform/src/modules/restaurants/restaurants.module.ts:19:0-77:33) to use TypeORM entities and repositories

5. Updated the progress tracker to mark the restaurant menu catalog task as completed

The implementation now provides a high-performance restaurant and menu catalog system that meets the latency requirements through efficient database design and Redis caching with versioned keys.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
