## Product Requirements Document (PRD): SwiftEats – Food Delivery Backend

### 1. Business Scenario

- SwiftEats is launching a high-growth food delivery platform in Maharashtra.
- Competitive differentiation depends on a **high-performance, resilient, scalable backend** that provides a consistently excellent experience for consumers, restaurants, and drivers.

---

### 2. Core Business \& Operational Requirements

#### 2.1 Reliable Order Processing at Scale

- **Peak Traffic Goal:** Handle up to **500 orders per minute**.
- **Reliability**: Order capture, menu reads, and assignment should continue functioning even if third-party services (like payment gateways) are down.
- **Mock Payment Gateway** integration must allow for end-to-end flow testing and failure handling.
- **Order Atomicity:** Each order transaction must either fully succeed or fail (avoid "half-complete" orders).

#### 2.2 Snappy Menu \& Restaurant Browsing

- **Performance Target:** Fetch restaurant menus/status with P99 latency <200ms during heavy load.
- **Freshness:** Data (e.g., availability, out-of-stock, hours) must be accurate; stale data is not acceptable for users.
- **Scalability:** The browse/catalog service must scale independently of the order-processing system.

#### 2.3 Real-Time Logistics \& Analytics

- **Scale:** Support up to **10,000 concurrent drivers** (peak: 2,000 location updates/sec).
- **Real-Time Driver Tracking:** Show near-instantaneous (≤2s lag) driver location to customers.
- **Analytics Support:** Ingest, process, and make available raw and processed GPS streams.
- **Local Demonstration:** Provide a simulator for **50 drivers/10 updates/sec** to validate system function on a dev machine.

### 3. Key Architectural Attributes

- **Scalability:** Each critical subsystem (orders, menu browse, real-time tracking) can be scaled out independently.
- **Resilience:** Failure of any external or non-core subsystem (e.g., payment, recommendations, analytics) must not impact the core ordering path.
- **Performance:** All critical endpoints must meet performance SLAs under stress.
- **Maintainability:** Codebase is modular; CI/CD and clear APIs support rapid changes and safe deployment.

### 4. Architectural Considerations

**4.1 Application Design**

- Consider **modular monolith** for rapid development, with clear separation between:
  - Order management
  - Menu/catalog service
  - Real-time logistics \& notifications
  - Payments
  - User profiles
  - Restaurant management
- Plan for eventual migration of modules into microservices if traffic/data demands increase.

**4.2 Tech Stack/Infrastructure Choices**

- **Backend frameworks:** Node.js/NestJS, Django (Python), or Laravel/Symfony (PHP) for rapid prototyping, strong ecosystem, and performance at scale.
- **Primary database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB (relational for orders, NoSQL for real-time feeds).
- **In-memory caching:** Redis or Memcached to achieve menu/catalog latency targets.
- **Async/message queuing:** RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka (for order workflows and GPS tracking ingestion).
- **Event streaming:** Apache Kafka recommended for driver/location feeds and analytics pipeline.
- **Web server:** NGINX or Apache as a front-end gateway/load balancer.

**4.3 Resilience and Failover**

- Implement circuit breaker patterns between backend and third-party integrations (e.g., payment).
- Ensure idempotency for order and payment APIs.
- Store all orders in persistent storage before interacting with third parties—never “lose” an order due to an upstream failure.

**4.4 AI Assistant Collaboration**

- Use AI copilots for:
  - Architecture brainstorming supported with rapid pros/cons matrixes or code snippets
  - Stress/load test scenario generation
  - Code review and style enforcement
  - Incident detection/intelligent alert triage (AI assists SRE/DevOps)
- Optionally, AI chatbots for customer service or order help

### 5. Functional Requirements Summary Table

| Requirement                 | Scale/SLA            | Resilience              | Performance Target  |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ |
| Order processing            | 500 orders/min       | Survive 3rd-party fail  | <2s end-to-end      |
| Menu/catalog browse         | Peak user load       | Cache for fast failover | P99 <200ms          |
| GPS driver update ingestion | 2,000 events/sec     | Event queue buffering   | ≤2s lag to customer |
| Payment gateway (mock)      | End-to-end flow only | Circuit breaker         | N/A                 |

---

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Data encryption in transit, secure APIs following OAuth2 best practices.
- **Observability:** Centralized logging, metrics, and distributed tracing with dashboards (ELK/Prometheus/Grafana).
- **Extensibility:** Clean REST/gRPC APIs for adding restaurants, analytics, or notification services.

---

### 7. Operational/QA Considerations

- Provide a **driver data generator/simulator** for robust local/load testing.
- Automated and manual failover tests: Simulate payment, DB, or cache outages and measure user impact.
- Performance/stress CI with realistic workloads against all major APIs.

---

### 8. Rationale \& Best Practice References

- Modular, scalable design is proven in successful food delivery case studies and technical breakdowns.
- AI-supported engineering tools improve code quality, speed up brainstorming, and increase resilience by spotting issues faster.
- In-memory caching and async/event-driven architectures are industry standards for high-concurrency, low-latency web applications.
